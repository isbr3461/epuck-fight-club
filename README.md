How to run: Make sure texture file "newterritory.png" imported correctly, and that the bot inside the square has the controller "finalprojcontroller" and that the bot outside the square has the controller "finalprojwanderingcontroller". Running should proceed smoothly after that. As the bots turn quite slow, it may be necessary to speed up the simulation to complete the fight.
